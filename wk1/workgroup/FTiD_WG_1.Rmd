</div>

## Workgroup Meetings

<h3>Working on assignments<h3>
Applying the lecture topics to own (real) data sets.


## Assignments - Overview {.columns-2 .smaller}

<h3> Individual Assignment </h3>
- Preparation for the group assignments
- Graded with a pass/fail
- <b><u>Deadline: Wednesday 30th of November, 17:00 </u></b>

<h3> Assignment 1 </h3>
- Group assignment
- Linear regression
- <b><u>Deadline: Monday 19th of December, 17:00</u></b>

<p class="forceBreak"></p>

<h3> Assignment 2 </h3>
- Group assignment
- Same groups as Assignment 1
- Logistic regression
- <b><u>Deadline: Thursday 19th of January, 17:00 </u></b>

## Assignments - General Comments

<h3> Grading:</h3>
- Both group assignments contribute 25% to your final grade (50% together).
- All group members receive same grade for group assignments
- If names are omitted from groups/assignments, we expect everyone to be aware of that.

<h3> Hand-in:</h3>
- Hand in assignments via SurfFileDrop
- Hand in .zip folder with R project and all files (HTML, Rmarkdown, data sets)
- Make sure all code and text are visible in the HTML files
- HTML files are graded; supplementary files are needed when HTML seems incomplete

## Individual Assignment

In this assignment, you individually search for a data set that could potentially be used for assignments 1 and 2. You describe the research questions you will try to answer using this data set for the two assignment, and you apply processing steps if required.

You make an R project and an R markdown file where you:

- Load the data set
- Explore the variables in this data set
- Describe the research questions
- Identify processing steps
- Summarize processed variables

<b><u><em>All assignment information can be found on the course website!</em></u></b>

## Data set - Requirements

The data set for the individual assignment (and subsequently for the group assignments) has a number of requirements. The data set should <b><u>at least</u></b> contain:

- A continuous outcome variable
- At least two continuous predictor variables
- A categorical predictor variable
- A dichotomous outcome variable

## Data set - Tips

There are a lot of online places that offer good data sets for these assignments. Below, some examples are listed:

- Kaggle
- Github
- CBS / Eurostat
- RIVM
- Via scientific papers
- Via large panel studies (e.g. PISA, LISS, EVS, ESS, TIMSS)
- Previous courses?

<br>
<b><em><u>Datasets from lectures and practicals are not allowed for these assignments</u></em></b>

## Remainder of the meeting

<h4> 1\. Start looking for a data set:</h3>
- Look for something you find interesting
- Make sure the data set meets the requirements
- Check if you can actually obtain the data! 

<h4> 2\. Start formulating research questions:</h3>
- Based on the variables in your data set/the topic of your data set, come up with questions that you want to investigate.
- Research questions need to be about relations between the variables

<h4> 3\. Start inspecting your data set:</h3>
- Is recoding of variables needed?
- Is any processing needed? (If you want to use factor analysis or PCA, you are free to do so)
- Describe your variables, present relations between variables (plots!!).


## For the next meetings

<b><u><em> Keep working on your individual assignment (you can work together, the 'individual' part is on how it is handed in and graded).</em></u></b>
