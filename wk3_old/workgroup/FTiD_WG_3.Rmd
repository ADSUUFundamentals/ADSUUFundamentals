## This Workgroup Meeting

<h3> 1\. Forming groups </h3>
<h3> 2\. Pitching proposals </h3>
<h3> 3\. Present choices </h3>
<h3> 4\. Starting group assignment </h3>


## Forming Groups

<h3> - Groups consist of 3 to 4 students </h3>
<h3> - Both assignment 1 and 2 will be in these groups </h3>
<h3> - Forming groups with similar topics can help </h3>


## Formed a group? Pitch!


<h4> Pitch individual assignments (data, research questions), use the produced HTML</h4>

<br>
<h4> Evaluate each pitch</h4>

- Are data processing steps done correctly?
- Is the topic interesting and are the Research questions relevant? 

<h4> As a group, choose the data set that you want to use for the assignments </h4>

<br>
<h3> 4 rounds of 5 minutes </h3>

## Group Choices
<br><br>
<p id ="centertext"> As a group, present the data set you chose </p>

## Assignment 1

<h4>You perform a multiple linear regression analysis in R and report this using R markdown. The assignment will be graded on the following four elements:</h4><br>

-	<b>Exploratory data analysis:</b> Introduction of your research questions, description and potential processing of your data. 
-	<b>Linear regression:</b> Description of the model fit and model comparison procedure
-	<b>Assumptions:</b> Testing of model assumptions, checking for outliers and influential cases. Act upon and/or reflect on violations when needed.
-	<b>Interpretation:</b> Substantive interpretation of the final model. Answer to your research question.
-	<b>Layout:</b> Structure of the document, output if efficiently presented, custom functions are developed when needed. Graphs are presented where suitable. 

<b><u><em> Find the complete assignment discription on the course web site.</em></u></b>

## Remainder of Meeting
